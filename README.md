4x1 Multiplexer using 2x1 MUX in Verilog

This project demonstrates the hierarchical design of a 4x1 multiplexer by combining smaller 2x1 MUX modules in Verilog.

📌 Features

Simple 2x1 MUX as the basic building block.

Structural design of 4x1 MUX using three 2x1 MUXes.

Testbench included for simulation and verification.

Supports both manual test cases and exhaustive input testing.

🛠️ Tools Used

Verilog HDL

Any simulator (Vivado / ModelSim / EDA Playground)

🎯 Learning Outcome

This implementation shows how complex digital circuits can be built from smaller modules, reinforcing the concept of hierarchical and modular design in digital systems.
